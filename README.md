Road safety is a significant issue that affects communities throughout. With great pleasure, I present the Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, an advanced analytical and visual aid for road accident data for 2021 and 2022. With the help of this Excel-based dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions and create a safer driving environment.

1.	Total Casualties Analysis- The dashboard shows that over the two years, an unbelievable 417,883 casualties resulted from accidents. This alarming statistic emphasizes how urgent it is to make road safety measures a top priority.





2.	 Casualties by Vehicle Type- Most of the casualties 79.8% of the total were caused by car accidents. However, in collisions involving other kinds of vehicles, there were not many casualties.


 





3.	Monthly Trend Analysis- The dashboard finds important times and seasonal patterns by analyzing monthly casualty trends from the current year and previous years. Authorities can start campaigns and take action to lower the number of accidents during high-risk times because of this knowledge.
 
4.	Casualties by Road Type- Developing successful road safety policies requires identifying the road types that are linked to the greatest number of casualties. The dashboard identifies the sorts of roads that need to have their infrastructure improved and safety measures enhanced.
 


5.	 Casualties by Road Surface- Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential. This data-driven approach enhances decision-making and resource allocation.
 

6.	Casualties by Location/Area and Casualties by Light condition- Important insights can be gained by examining the connection between casualties and the area/location of accidents, as well as the differences between day and night accidents. These results make it possible to implement focused initiatives to raise road safety in certain locations and at times.
 
 

 
With the help of our Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, stakeholders may make data-driven decisions and put into practice evidence-based actions that improve road safety. It is an important tool for safety advocates and traffic officials.
